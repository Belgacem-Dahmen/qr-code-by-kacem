#  QR code component

## Welcome! 👋


## The challenge


## Where to find everything

My task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

This challenge is completely free. Please share it with anyone who will find it useful for practice.

**Have fun !** 🚀
